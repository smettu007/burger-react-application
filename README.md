i used fire base to manage backend. Ingredients are pulled from firebase. Once you hit checkout and continue orders are placed in firabse databse. After i implement routing in this project then i will pull up chheckout data to display as checkout summary.

to run this project locally use npm install and npm start.

stay tuned for updates
